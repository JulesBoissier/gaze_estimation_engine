**Vision Tracking Engine:** The central orchestration object leveraging composition of the three other key component to manage calibration profiles and predict point of regard.

**Gaze Predictor:** A wrapper around the L2CSNet model which, given an image, returns a prediction for the Gaze Vector of the person in the picture, along with coordinates of their eyes.

**Calibration Agent:** Runs interpolation to predict the Point of Regard, given a Gaze vector by leveraging pre-recorded calibration points.

**Calibration Profile Store:** An SQLAlchemy-based database handler to store and retrieve Calibration Profiles.


## Usage

1. Download the pre-trained Gaze360 Model from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17p6ORr-JQJcw-eYtG2WGNiuS_qVKwdWd) and drop the pickle file into the models directory.

2. Run docker-compose to build the container and persistent volume.

3. Optionally, load an existing profile from the persistent volume.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/load_profile?profile_id=1"
```

4. Curl a few calibration points to the /cal_point end-point to configure a calibration profile. 

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/cal_point" \
     -F "file=@image.jpg" \
     -F "x=0" \
     -F "y=100"
```

5. Optionally save the profile to re-use later.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/save_profile?name=my_profile"
```

6. Predict the Point of Regard based on a new image.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict" -F "file=@new_image.jpg"
```


## TODOs:

Future improvements for later versions:

**Vision Tracking Engine:**
- Support for multi-screen prediction.

**Calibration Agent:**
- Add support for more interpolation methods.
- Use predicted X, Y positions for more accurate predictions.

**Gaze Predictor:**
- Improve test coverage.
